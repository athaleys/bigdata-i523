    title: Recipe Ingredients Analysis
    abstract: >
        The ingredients used in the recipe can provide a lot of information
        about the type of cuisine and culture. It is one of the important
        factors to decide the dish pricing in the restaurant and can provide
        cost analysis based on the ingredient cost. Replacing one
        ingredient with another substitute ingredient can change the cost
        dramatically and can make you profitable. It might be possible
        to predict the type of weather area receives based on the ingredients
        as well as the cuisine type. In continuation of my paper 1 of
        big analytics in the restaurant industry, we would like to analyze
        ingredients getting used in recipe across cuisines. This would be
        the quest to find out most used ingredient globally and across
        various cuisines. We would like to use learning from my paper 2
        about MongoDB if required in this project.
